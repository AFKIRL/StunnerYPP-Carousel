# StunnerYPP-Carousel

This is the answer for the first test which was to create a carousel emulating a provided GIF file,
Regretably the pictures in the link were not valid anymore so I had to adjust and source out for another set of images that will 
be used for the carousel

Regarding the bonus question, given the oppurtinity to actually use other tools I would be using chakra ui along with react to develop a better carousel
